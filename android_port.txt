---- Problems and cons.

1. Pixel is not the same, using density pixel (1px on desktop = 1/dip on Android)
2. The density of object world may reduce due to their big dimensions
3. Screen dimensions have more pixels
4. It's Important to develop all the game in small view and then do the projection on larger screen (multiply by a scale factor)
5. The Logcat of Android Studio is slow to get the information, so try use the canvas view to show accurate infos.
